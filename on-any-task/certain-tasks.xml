If you are walking, focus foremost on safely
navigating your environment - keeping an eye out
for everything from potholes
to stray branches to even fellow pedestrians.
Secondarily, focus on knowing the next few
turns you must make and not missing any of
them - all the while avoiding any wrong turns.
Third, focus on your posture, your gait,
and on resisting any undesired habits that you
tend to manifest while walking.
Wit what attention is left, take in and
appreciate your environment.

Are you neatifying the house?
Again, as with walking, the first focus is on safe
navigation of your environment.
Next comes the object you are dealing with
at the moment - as in, what to do with it,
where to put it, stuff like that.
Then the next area of focus is on the broader picture
of the next few things to take care of
after the present object.
If you have an itinerary to guide you in this,
do not hesitate to use it.
But at any rate, make sure you
don't end up aimless once you're done
with the object at hand.
Finally, then, come once again the issues of
posture and habits of motion.

<p>
If, during neatification,
you come across an object
that you don't know what to do with -
then stop and give it your full,
almost-meditative attention
to resolve your issues with the object.
You must either get to the point
of knowing what to do with the object
keeping it in your household -
or to the point that you
no longer feel any need to keep it
and you know how to get rid of it.
</p>

<p>
As for the idea of disposing an object
despite not having detached yourself from it
out of the intellectual realization that it
is better to get rid of - such actions
may aid the neatification process in the
short run - but will come back to haunt it
in the long run.
