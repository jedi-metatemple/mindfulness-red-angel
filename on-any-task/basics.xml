<p>
For any task you may be doing, there is a specific
set of things
that demand your focus.
Know what that set of things is,
and meditate on them while doing the task.
Let these things be
what you focus on, and if you catch any thoughts adrift,
gently guide them back to what they should be on.
</p>

<p>
When you hear the chime of the Mindfulness Bell,
let that be a special reminder to you to
return your attention to these deserving areas.
Do so as you perform the acknowledgement ritual of the bell
- or at very least, as soon as you finish the
acknowledgement ritual.
But only treat it so as a special reminder - for if you
catch your mind straying, you must gently return it to where it belongs, whether the Mindfulness Bell has just rung or not.
