<title>On the Mindfulness Bell</title>
<lcn>

<p>
Mindfulness is a habit that must be cultivated.
</p>

<p>
Use a Mindfulness Bell that chimes,
neither too predictably nor too erratically,
as a tool to help keep on track
with your mindfulness training.
When you hear it chime, stop,
and center yourself on the here-and-now.
</p>

<p>
The actual physical stopping and taking of
three breaths upon hearing the
Mindfulness Bell chime - a practice
customary among Zen Buddhists - can be useful.
The heart of the practice is in how
you are more fully centered
on the here-and-now afterwards,
once you go on with what you are doing -
but the physical stopping and taking of three breaths
can aid your habit of doing so in a variety of ways.
