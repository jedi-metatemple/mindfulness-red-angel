<p>
This is not a guide to Mindfulness for Anyone.
Any guide that claims to be is either too
general to suffice for all but the gifted few
for whom mindfulness comes most naturally -
or a collection of several guides wrapped into
one enormously large one -
or simply false in the claims of being for everyone.
Unfortunately, the last of these possibilities
is in most cases the most likely -
as too many people who write on and teach such subjects
underestimate the impact of human diversity
on how one should approach such things
as the practice of mindfulness.

<p>
This guide is also not a Revealed Document handed
down from some Sage on High, but a bi-product of study
on the subject written to minimize the repetition
of mistakes and to maximize successful practices.
